implement
- code cleanup
- FIND OPTIMUM THEN DISPLAY THING-OPT
- test COVER
- clusterSVRG
- clustered sampling: MAKE IT WORK OR PROVE THAT IT DOESN'T

- adjust by time elapsed (time.perf_counter())

- CRAIG?
- gradient cluster from Faghri?


performance:
- GPU acceleration -> check if possible
- accuracy over time
- nb of iterations + time of reaching a certain accuracy
- time of each iteration
