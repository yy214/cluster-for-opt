implement
- SVRG (or find implem for minibatch) -> understand code
    where is the \nabla_i f(snap)
- clusterSVRG, COVER (warning: need minibatch implem, get inspiration from SVRG)
- cluster block CD -> implement clustered sampling
    how to actually sample evenly with clusters if the number of clusters doesn't divide the batch size?
    solution: successive sampling

https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html#full-implementation 
- CRAIG?
- gradient cluster from Faghri?

need to compare sampling each time / successive sampling



performance:
- GPU acceleration -> check if possible
- accuracy over time
- nb of iterations + time of reaching a certain accuracy
- time of each iteration
