new experiments (fast)
- linear regression with N < DIM -> debug
- clustering for successive
- if nothing works, show that cluster kaczmarz works



code cleanup AFTER submitting the paper
- remove timestamps which don't make sense anymore
- text in readme + in the notebook
- saving simulations
- cleaner code (spaces and stuff idk the name of it)


can check gradient-cluster from faghri


threads

fix minibatch svrg -> snapshot epoch change i guess
fix cluster svrg
fix cover (assumes we need to fix variances still or it's not worth it)
