code cleanup AFTER submitting the paper
- correct the 01 -> +/- 1
- check if everything works
- fix the clone model (or nuke it as it's for svrg)
- text in readme + in the notebook
- saving simulations
- cleaner code (spaces and stuff idk the name of it)


can check gradient-cluster from faghri


threads

fix minibatch svrg -> snapshot epoch change i guess
fix cluster svrg
fix cover (assumes we need to fix variances still or it's not worth it)
